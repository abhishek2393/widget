🚀 Exciting news! I have a fantastic project to share with all you web developers out there! 🌐✨

Introducing the super flexible and sleek widget - Hellobar! 🎉 Built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, and powered by Vite, this single-file script tag can be seamlessly imported into any website or app. 😍😱

But here's the best part: I've created a foolproof readme.md file that guides you through the installation process and explains every command you need to know to get started on this project. 💯💻

Let's dive right in:

1️⃣ Clone this repository.

2️⃣ Navigate into the project folder.

3️⃣ Run "npm install".

4️⃣ To start development mode, run "npm run dev".

Once you're ready to build and serve your project:

5️⃣ Execute "npm run build".

6️⃣ Then, simply use "npm run serve" to see it in action.

Remember that inside the dist folder, you'll find your build files. The index.html file houses your masterpiece, along with an assets folder containing a singular js file.

And here's where it gets personal:

To customize your widget's position on the page, just add these data attributes - data-position="top" data-id="Pxwqwer" - to your script tag in the index.html file. 🤩

For example:

These handy attributes will define exactly where your widget shines!
